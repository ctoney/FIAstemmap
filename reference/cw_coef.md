# Regression coefficients for predicting tree crown width

A curated set of linear regression coefficients for predicting crown
width from stem diameter of tree species in the conterminous US.

## Usage

``` r
cw_coef
```

## Format

### `cw_coef`

A data frame with 430 rows and 8 columns:

- `symbol`:

  [`character`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/character.html), USDA PLANTS
  Database species symbol

- `SPCD`:

  [`integer`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/integer.html), FIA tree species
  code or `-1`

- `common_name`:

  [`character`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/character.html), FIA tree species
  common name

- `surrogate`:

  [`character`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/character.html), Common name of
  surrogate species if applicable

- `b0`:

  [`numeric`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/numeric.html), Regression b0
  coefficient

- `b1`:

  [`numeric`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/numeric.html), Regression b1
  coefficient

- `b1`:

  [`numeric`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/numeric.html), Regression b2
  coefficient

- `reference`:

  [`character`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/character.html), Literature
  source of the species coefficients (see References)

## Details

The regression equation is of the general form:

    CW = b0 + b1 * DIA + b2 * DIA^2

where `CW` is the predicted tree crown diameter in feet, `DIA` is FIA
stem diameter in inches, and `b0`, `b1`, `b2` are the regression
coefficients. The quadratic term `b2` was not included in the regression
models for some species, and has been assigned `0` in that case for
purposes of this lookup table.

In cases that species-specific equations were not available in the
literature, surrogate species were assigned based on subjectively
similar tree physiognomy.
