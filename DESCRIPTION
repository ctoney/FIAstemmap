Description: Maps individual tree stem locations on field plots of the Forest
    Inventory and Analysis (FIA) Program of USDA Forest Service. Stem locations
    are mapped in cartesian coordinate space based on distance and azimuth
    offsets from subplot and microplot centers. Per-tree crown widths are
    estimated using a set of allometric equations with coverage for the
    conterminous US, and provided as an optional output. Spatial descriptors of
    tree point pattern are computed at the whole plot level. Several stand
    height metrics are also computed and provided in the output. The spatial
    representation of modeled tree crowns is used to generate estimates of
    fractional tree canopy cover at the microplot, subplot and whole plot
    levels. Provides facilities for exploratory data analysis and integration
    with the 'spatstat' library.
