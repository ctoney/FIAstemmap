Description: Maps individual tree stem locations on Forest Inventory and
    Analysis field plots. Stem locations are mapped in cartesian coordinate
    space based on distance and azimuth offsets from subplot and microplot
    centers. Per-tree crown widths are estimated using a set of allometric
    equations with coverage for the conterminous US. The crown width estimates
    are provided as an optional output. Spatial descriptors of point pattern
    are computed at the whole plot level. Several plot-level stand height
    metrics are also computed and provided in the output. Tree crowns are
    modeled as discs and used to produce modeled estimates of plot-level tree
    canopy cover.
