\description{
A curated set of linear regression coefficients for predicting crown width
from stem diameter of tree species in the conterminous US.
}
\details{
The regression equation is of the general form:

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{CW = b0 + b1 * DIA + b2 * DIA^2
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

where \code{CW} is the predicted tree crown diameter in feet, \code{DIA} is FIA stem
diameter in inches, and \code{b0}, \code{b1}, \code{b2} are the regression coefficients.
The quadratic term \code{b2} was not included in the regression models for some
species, and has been assigned \code{0} in that case for purposes of this lookup
table.

In cases that species-specific equations were not available in the
literature, surrogate species were assigned based on subjectively similar
tree physiognomy.
