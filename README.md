# FIA stem map

NOTE: this repository is for an implementation update *currently under
development*

The Forest Inventory and Analysis Program
([FIA](https://research.fs.usda.gov/programs/nfi)) of USDA Forest
Service provide tree-level measurements from a systematic grid of field
plots across all forest ownerships and land uses in the US.
**FIAstemmap** is an R package for mapping tree stem locations on FIA
plots, modeling individual crown dimensions, and generating plot-level
estimates of fractional tree canopy cover. Several stand height metrics
can be calculated. Spatial analysis of tree point pattern is facilitated
for the standard FIA four-point cluster plot design. Efficient data
processing supports national applications. The package provides an
updated implementation of the software originally described by Toney et
al. 2009 [\[1\]](#References). The original implementation for modeling
plot canopy cover from individual tree measurements has supported
several applications of FIA data, including:

- reference data for classifying vegetation types and mapping tree
  canopy cover in the LANDFIRE Program [\[2, 3, 4, 5\]](#References)
- National Land Cover Database (NLCD) Tree Canopy Cover (TCC) science
  and development [\[6\]](#References)
- wildlife habitat analyses [\[7, 8, 9\]](#References)
- mapping erosion risk in rangelands [\[10\]](#References)
- comparative assessments of tree canopy cover estimation methods [\[11,
  12\]](#References)

## Installation

You can install the development version of **FIAstemmap** with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("ctoney/FIAstemmap")
```

## Example

TODO…

``` r
library(FIAstemmap)
## basic example code
```
